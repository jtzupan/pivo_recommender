    "Phrase modeling is an approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaning multi-word concepts.

Like the best pancake house in the world, with grade A maple syrup made in house  a cold press coffee place beside the kitchen. Then the waitress sets a glass of bourbon next to the syrup. Seriously. Magnificent.   Kentucky Brunch is one of those beers that can't possibly live up to the hype, right? Wrong. More maple syrup taste than any beer I've ever come into contact with -  I like small-batch, artisanal maple syrup almost as much as I like beer. And I swear I can taste the waffles. Big bourbon wallop is cut by just the right amount of coffee; not enough to tip this into an annoying coffee bomb, but enough to get a taste. Mild chocolate  vanilla  drying wood in the middle. The end is pure bliss. Thick, thick, thicker, but ridiculously drinkable. I'm thinking of stealing my wife's half  making a run for it. I'm faster than she is. She'd never catch me before I finished it.   Holy bloody hell. I wish I'd have brought 36 mules to the release, because I would have drunk every single bottle in a span of about 20 days. This is a beautiful beer,  I hope it turns into an annual release. No, screw that, a weekly release. This beer is...perfect. My fourth perfect score in 1500 reviews. Wow.
